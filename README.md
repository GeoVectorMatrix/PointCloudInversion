# PointCloudInversion

C++ codes for "Point Cloud Inversion: A Novel Approach for the Localization of Trees in Forests from TLS Data" will be released soon after the publication.

This paper proposes a fast and easy-to-use method (Point Cloud Inversion, PCI) for localizing trees in TLS point clouds. The input for PCI is the raw point clouds and no other pre-processing steps (e.g., ground filtering, PCA-based features, noise-removal) are needed. PCI is also a plug-in module and may benefit other object localization tasks, such as pole-like objects in urban areas.
